A **palico** is a cat-companion from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate that assists the hunter on quests.

This palicode is a compendium of quest information that a hunter can reference to see what is required to make it to the next Hunter Rank. Really though it was an excuse to play with Ember.js. :smile_cat:
